	<string name="text_description">An ordered broadcast is similar to a normal broadcast, except it delivers to
		receivers with a higher priority first. Those receivers, if they choose, can abort the broadcast to prevent
		lower priority receivers from catching them.

		\n\nThis app demonstrate this functionality by showing a toast if the application is in the foreground, and
		showing a status bar notification if it is in the background. Go ahead, try it out! Press \"Start
		broadcasts\" to get started!
